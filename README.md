📂 Dataset
Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Source: Kaggle


🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

Pandas – Data handling & preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Model training & evaluation

Matplotlib – Visualization

🔍 Steps Followed (Mini Guide Applied)
1 - Choose a binary classification dataset – Selected Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

2 - Train/Test Split & Standardization – Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, standardized features using StandardScaler.

3 - Fit Logistic Regression Model – Used LogisticRegression() from scikit-learn.

4 - Evaluate Model –

 * Confusion Matrix

 * Precision & Recall

 * ROC-AUC Score and ROC Curve visualization

5 - Tune Threshold & Explain Sigmoid Function –

 * Adjusted decision threshold to improve performance.

 * Illustrated and explained the sigmoid curve for probability prediction.
